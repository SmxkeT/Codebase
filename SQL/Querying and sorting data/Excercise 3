Exercise03: On the select clause – combine the persons first name with their name last to be shown as the alias called ‘Fullname’

Use the ORDER BY clause to sort according to one of the attributes 

select country_id, country_name, region_id

FROM countries

order by country_name DESC;

Sort according to two attributes – when not specifically mentioned next to the attributes it means an Ascending sort

SELECT last_name, first_name, phone_number

FROM employees

order by lastname, first_name;
